# Letter to Vern: Session Debugging Issue

**Date:** September 23, 2025  
**From:** Chuckles  
**To:** Vern  
**Subject:** Critical Session Bug - User Authenticated on Client, Not on Server

## Executive Summary

Hey Vern! Chuckles here. We've got a real head-scratcher of a bug that's got me stumped. Users appear logged in on the dashboard (client-side) but API routes can't access their session (server-side). This is causing 500 errors on all authenticated endpoints, including the reset functionality we've been working on.

I've been debugging this for hours and I'm starting to think I'm missing something obvious. The user can log in fine, but the server acts like they're not authenticated at all. Classic client/server session mismatch, but I can't figure out where the disconnect is happening.

## The Problem

**What's Working (The Good News):**
- ‚úÖ User can log in via Auth0 (302 redirect to Auth0)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows "Hello, Susan Somerset!" (client-side authentication)
- ‚úÖ Canvas API calls work (43 courses, 2 observees)
- ‚úÖ All Canvas fetcher functions fixed (pagination, observer enrollments)

**What's Broken (The Bad News):**
- ‚ùå API routes return 500 errors
- ‚ùå `getSession()` in API routes returns `null`
- ‚ùå Reset endpoint fails with authentication error
- ‚ùå All server-side session handling fails

It's like the user is living in two different worlds - authenticated in one, not authenticated in the other. Very frustrating!

## Root Cause Analysis

I think the issue is a **client/server session mismatch**, but I'm not 100% sure:

1. **Client-side**: `useUser()` hook works and shows user as authenticated
2. **Server-side**: `getSession()` in API routes cannot find the session
3. **Result**: User appears logged in but server can't access session data

This is driving me crazy because everything looks correct on the surface, but there's clearly something I'm missing about how Auth0 sessions work in Next.js.

## Code Files Responsible for Session Establishment

### 1. **`src/app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.ts`** - Auth0 Route Handler
```typescript
import { handleAuth, handleLogin } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0';

export const GET = handleAuth({
  login: handleLogin({
    returnTo: '/dashboard'
  })
});
export const POST = GET;
```
**Purpose:** Handles all Auth0 authentication flows (login, logout, callback)
**Potential Issue:** This is where the session should be established after login

### 2. **`src/middleware.ts`** - Route Protection
```typescript
import { withMiddlewareAuthRequired } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge';

export default withMiddlewareAuthRequired();

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/dashboard/:path*',
    '/settings/:path*',
    '/api/student-data/:path*',
  ],
};
```
**Purpose:** Protects routes and should establish session context
**Potential Issue:** Edge runtime might have different session handling

### 3. **`src/lib/auth/auth0.ts`** - Session Helper
```typescript
import { getSession } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0';

export async function requireSession() {
  const session = await getSession();
  if (!session) {
    throw new Error('AUTH_REQUIRED');
  }
  return session;
}
```
**Purpose:** Server-side session validation
**Potential Issue:** `getSession()` not finding sessions established by client

### 4. **`src/app/layout.tsx`** - Auth0 Provider
```typescript
import { UserProvider } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/client';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <UserProvider>
          {children}
        </UserProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
**Purpose:** Provides Auth0 context to client components
**Potential Issue:** Client/server context mismatch

## Debugging Evidence

**Session Test Results:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "authenticated": false,
  "error": "No session found"
}
```

**User Experience:**
- User logs in successfully (sees "Hello, Susan Somerset!")
- User clicks "Refresh & View StudentData"
- Gets 500 Internal Server Error
- Server logs show "AUTH_REQUIRED" error

## Potential Issues

1. **Cookie Domain Mismatch**: Session cookies might not be accessible to API routes
2. **Edge Runtime Issues**: Middleware uses edge runtime, might have different session handling
3. **Auth0 Configuration**: Missing or incorrect Auth0 environment variables
4. **Session Storage**: Sessions might not be persisting between client and server
5. **CORS Issues**: Session cookies might not be sent with API requests

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Check Auth0 Dashboard**: Verify callback URLs and allowed origins
2. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all Auth0 variables are correctly set
3. **Check Cookie Settings**: Verify session cookies are being set and sent
4. **Check Auth0 Version**: Ensure we're using compatible versions
5. **Check Next.js Configuration**: Verify Auth0 integration is properly configured

## Code Files to Investigate

**Primary Suspects:**
- `src/app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.ts` - Session establishment
- `src/middleware.ts` - Route protection and session context
- `src/lib/auth/auth0.ts` - Session validation

**Secondary Files:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Auth0 provider setup
- `package.json` - Auth0 version compatibility
- `.env.local` - Environment variable configuration

## Request for Help

Vern, I'm at my wits' end with this one. This is a critical blocker preventing the reset functionality from working. The user can log in but the server can't access their session, causing all authenticated API routes to fail.

I've been staring at these files for hours and I can't figure out what's wrong. Could you help me identify:
1. Which of these files is most likely causing the session issue?
2. What specific configuration might be missing?
3. How to debug the session establishment process?

The reset endpoint logic is working (we've tested it with debug endpoints), but the authentication layer is preventing it from running. It's like having a perfectly good car with no key to start it!

I'm probably missing something really obvious, but I just can't see it. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Canvas API integration complete
- ‚úÖ Reset endpoint logic complete  
- ‚úÖ Observer enrollment handling complete
- ‚ùå **Authentication layer broken** (blocking everything)

We need to fix the session handling before we can proceed with the reset functionality. I'm really hoping you can spot what I'm missing!

---

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** All authenticated features non-functional  
**Next Action:** Debug session establishment process (with Vern's help!)

Thanks for taking a look at this, Vern. I'm sure it's something simple that I'm just not seeing.
