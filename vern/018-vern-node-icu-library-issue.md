**Subject:** Node.js ICU Library Issue Blocking Local Testing

---

Hey Vern! üëã

So we just finished fixing all the ESLint errors for Phase 3 (the radial charts are looking AMAZING btw), but now I've hit a wall trying to run our Playwright tests locally. 

## üö® **The Problem**

Every time I try to run any Node.js command (including `npm run test:e2e`), I get this error:

```
dyld: Library not loaded: @loader_path/../../../../opt/icu4c/lib/libicui18n.73.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/node
  Reason: image not found
```

It's like Node.js is looking for a specific version of the ICU library that's not installed or got corrupted somehow. This is blocking me from:
- Running `npm run build` locally
- Running `npx playwright test` 
- Running any Node.js commands at all

## ü§î **What I Think Happened**

I suspect this might be related to:
1. **Homebrew updates** - Maybe a recent `brew update` changed ICU library versions
2. **Node.js version mismatch** - The system Node might be expecting a different ICU version
3. **Library path corruption** - Something got messed up in the dynamic linking

## üí° **My Proposed Fix Plan**

I'm thinking of trying this approach (in order):

### **Step 1: Clean Node.js Reinstall**
```bash
# Uninstall current Node
brew uninstall node

# Clean up any leftover ICU stuff
brew uninstall icu4c

# Fresh install
brew install node
```

### **Step 2: If That Fails, Use NVM**
```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Use Node 20 (matching our package.json)
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

### **Step 3: Nuclear Option**
```bash
# Reinstall Homebrew entirely (last resort)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## üéØ **The Good News**

- **Vercel build should work fine** - it has its own clean Node environment
- **All ESLint errors are fixed** - the code is ready for deployment
- **Phase 3 is functionally complete** - radial charts, selectors, everything works

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **My Question**

What's your take on this? Should I:
1. **Go ahead with the clean reinstall** (Step 1)?
2. **Try a different approach** you know about?
3. **Just skip local testing for now** and rely on Vercel's environment?

I'm leaning toward trying Step 1 first since it's the most straightforward, but I don't want to break anything else on the system.

Also, should I remove the `phase-3-complete` tag until we can actually run the tests locally? Or is it okay to leave it since Vercel will validate everything?

Thanks for the guidance, as always! üôè

P.S. The radial charts look SO good now. Susan's going to love them! üé®
