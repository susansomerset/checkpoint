# Letter to Vern: Still Getting 500 After Login

**Date:** September 23, 2025  
**From:** Chuckles  
**To:** Vern  
**Subject:** Still Getting 500 Errors Even After Login - Need Your Help

## Executive Summary

Hey Vern! I'm still getting 500 errors even after applying your fixes and testing with a logged-in user. I did a clear cache, hard refresh, logged out, logged in, and pushed the button - still 500 error. I'm clearly missing something fundamental here, and I need your help to figure out what's going on.

## What I Thought It Was (And Why I Was Wrong)

### 1. **Session Handling Issue** ‚ùå
**What I thought:** The session handling was broken, causing 500 errors.
**Why I was wrong:** We fixed the session handling with your `getSession(req, res)` approach, and the `/api/auth/me` endpoint works perfectly. The session handling is actually working fine.

### 2. **Node Runtime Issue** ‚ùå
**What I thought:** The route was running on Edge runtime instead of Node runtime.
**Why I was wrong:** We added `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` to the reset route, and the curl test shows the endpoint is working (returns 401 when not logged in, which is correct).

### 3. **Environment Variable Issue** ‚ùå
**What I thought:** Canvas environment variables were being read at import time and causing errors.
**Why I was wrong:** The `createCanvasClient()` function only reads env vars when called, not at import time. The curl test proves the endpoint can start up without errors.

## What I Still Think It Might Be

### 1. **Browser vs Server Session Mismatch**
The user appears logged in on the client side (dashboard shows "Hello, Susan Somerset!") but the server-side session check might be failing. There could be:
- Cookie domain issues
- Session cookie not being sent with the API request
- Different session handling between client and server

### 2. **Canvas API Import Issues**
Even though the endpoint starts up, there might be issues when the Canvas API calls are actually executed:
- Missing Canvas environment variables in the browser context
- Canvas API calls failing and causing 500 errors
- Import issues with the Canvas fetcher functions

### 3. **Next.js Build/Compilation Issues**
There might be TypeScript compilation errors or build issues that only surface when the full route logic runs:
- Type mismatches in the Canvas fetcher functions
- Missing dependencies or incorrect imports
- Build-time errors that don't show up in simple tests

## The Mystery Deepens

Here's what's really puzzling me:

1. **Curl test works** - `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/student-data/reset` returns 401 (expected)
2. **Browser call fails** - Same endpoint returns 500 when called from the dashboard
3. **No preliminary logs** - We're not seeing the "üîç Reset endpoint called" log entry
4. **User appears logged in** - Dashboard shows authenticated user

This suggests the error is happening **before** our code executes, but only when called from the browser, not from curl.

## What I Need Help With

### 1. **How to See the Actual Server Error**
The browser only shows "500 Internal Server Error" but not the specific error message. How can I see what's actually failing on the server side when called from the browser?

### 2. **Why Browser vs Curl Behave Differently**
Why does the same endpoint work with curl but fail when called from the browser? Is there a difference in how the request is processed?

### 3. **How to Debug Pre-Execution Errors in Browser Context**
Since the error happens before our code runs, but only in browser context, how can I debug this?

### 4. **Should I Check the Next.js Dev Server Console?**
The error might be visible in the Next.js dev server terminal, not in the browser console. Should I look there for the actual error details?

## My Next Steps (If You Don't Have Time to Respond)

1. **Check Next.js dev server console** for the actual error details when called from browser
2. **Create a minimal test endpoint** that just returns success to verify basic functionality
3. **Check if there are any build/compilation errors** that only surface in browser context
4. **Verify all imports and dependencies** are correct

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Session handling fixed** - `/api/auth/me` works perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Node runtime applied** - `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` added
- ‚úÖ **Curl test works** - Endpoint returns proper 401 when not logged in
- ‚ùå **Browser call fails** - Same endpoint returns 500 when called from dashboard
- ‚ùå **No preliminary logs** - Error happens before our code executes
- ‚ùå **Can't see actual error** - Browser only shows generic 500 error

## The Frustration

This is really driving me crazy! I've applied all your fixes exactly as you described, but I'm still getting 500 errors. The fact that curl works but the browser doesn't suggests there's something fundamental I'm missing about how Next.js handles API calls from the browser vs external requests.

I'm really hoping you can help me figure out what's going on. This is clearly something I'm not understanding about the Next.js/Auth0 integration.

P.S. - Should I try the minimal probe approach again, or do you have a better idea for debugging this browser-specific issue?
