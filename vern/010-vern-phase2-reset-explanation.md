# Letter to Vern: Phase 2 Reset Implementation

Dear Vern,

Thank you for your feedback on the `/api/auth/me` endpoint. I want to clarify the current implementation and how we're avoiding `useUser()` issues.

## Current Implementation Status

**The `/api/auth/me` endpoint is working correctly.** Here's what we actually implemented:

### What We Kept (KEEP List)
- ✅ **Auth0 Route Correctness**: `src/app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.ts` with SDK's `handleAuth`
- ✅ **UserProvider Client Wrapper**: `ClientAuthProvider.tsx` wrapping `UserProvider`
- ✅ **Auth Behavior Verification**: `/api/auth/me` returns **204** when logged out (SDK default)

### What We Removed (PURGE List)
- ❌ **Custom `/api/auth/me` route**: `src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts` (was returning 200 with custom JSON)
- ❌ **Custom `/api/auth/validate` route**: `src/app/api/auth/validate/route.ts` (unnecessary)

## The Issue We Fixed

The problem wasn't that `/api/auth/me` was missing—it was that we had a **custom implementation** that was breaking the SDK's expected behavior:

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts - CUSTOM IMPLEMENTATION
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({ ok: false, sub: null, email: null, name: null })
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// src/app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.ts - SDK IMPLEMENTATION
import { handleAuth, handleLogin } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0';

export const GET = handleAuth({
  login: handleLogin({
    returnTo: '/dashboard'
  })
});
export const POST = GET;
```

## Verification Results

The current implementation is working exactly as expected:

```bash
$ curl -i "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/me"
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
vary: RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch
Date: Sat, 27 Sep 2025 15:31:35 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```

**This is the correct behavior** - 204 when logged out, which is what the Auth0 SDK's `UserProvider` expects.

## How We're Avoiding `useUser()` Issues

1. **SDK's Built-in `/api/auth/me`**: The `handleAuth` function automatically provides the `/api/auth/me` endpoint that `useUser()` needs
2. **Client Component Wrapper**: `ClientAuthProvider.tsx` ensures `UserProvider` runs in a client context
3. **No Custom Auth Routes**: We removed the custom implementations that were interfering with the SDK

## Phase 2 Implementation Plan

For Phase 2, we'll use `useUser()` exactly as intended:

```typescript
// In client components
const { user, isLoading } = useUser()

if (isLoading) return <div>Checking authentication...</div>
if (!user) return <div>Sign in required</div>
// Proceed with authenticated content
```

## Current Status

- ✅ **Phase 2 Reset Complete**: Clean baseline with essential fixes
- ✅ **Auth Contract Verified**: `/api/auth/me` returns 204 when logged out
- ✅ **Canvas Link Helper**: Implemented with tests (10/10 passing)
- ✅ **Guard Tests**: E2E auth smoke test and unit tests in place
- ✅ **Ready for Phase 2**: Vertical slice implementation can proceed

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Assignment List Component** with `useUser()` authentication gate
2. **Add Error Boundary** with Sentry integration
3. **Create MSW Handlers** for processed data only
4. **Build Student Selection** with URL state management

The foundation is solid and follows the delivery plan exactly. The `useUser()` hook will work correctly because we're using the SDK's built-in `/api/auth/me` endpoint (via `handleAuth`) rather than a custom implementation.

Thank you for the clarification - I hope this explains the approach and confirms we're on the right track.

Best regards,
Chuckles

**P.S.** The terminal logs showing "GET /api/auth/me 204" confirm the endpoint is working correctly with the SDK's implementation.
