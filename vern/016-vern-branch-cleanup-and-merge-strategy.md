# Letter to Vern: Branch Cleanup and Merge Strategy

Hey Vern!

So remember how you said you'd help me not go off the rails with this project? Well... I might have gone a *little* off the rails with the git branches üòÖ

## The Situation (AKA My Mess)

I successfully got Phase 2 working on the `phase-2-rebuild` branch (yay! üéâ) and even got it deployed to Vercel at `https://checkpoint-fawn.vercel.app/assignments`. But now I have like 5 different branches and I'm not sure what to do with them all!

The master branch is basically a hot mess right now - it's not even code-complete, so I don't think we need to be super careful about preserving it. But I wanted to check with you before I start deleting things and potentially break everything again.

## My Branch Collection (AKA The Evidence)

Here's what I've got lying around:

### The Good One:
- `phase-2-rebuild` - This is the golden child! Everything works, it's deployed, it's beautiful ‚ú®

### The Questionable Ones:
- `feat/phase2-slice` - This was my first attempt. It's like the rough draft that got replaced
- `triage-snapshot` - I made this when I was debugging and everything was broken. It's basically just me panicking
- `wip/hydration-investigation` - This was when I was trying to figure out why React was being weird. Spoiler: I figured it out!

### The Main One:
- `master` - This is supposed to be the main branch, but it's kind of a disaster right now

## My Plan (AKA Please Tell Me This Is Okay)

I was thinking:

1. **Merge `phase-2-rebuild` into `master`** - Just force it through since master isn't complete anyway
2. **Rename `phase-2-rebuild` to `phase-2-complete`** - Keep it as a reference in case I need to look back
3. **Delete the other branches** - They're just taking up space and confusing me
4. **Make `master` the main branch** - Clean slate for Phase 3!

## The Technical Stuff (AKA The Part Where I Sound Smart)

I know there will be merge conflicts, but since master isn't code-complete, I figured I'd just resolve them all in favor of the `phase-2-rebuild` branch. The working code is more important than the broken code, right?

I also already updated Vercel to deploy from master, so once I merge everything, the deployment should just work automatically. Fingers crossed! ü§û

## What I'm Worried About (AKA The Panic Section)

- What if I delete something important? (But I don't think any of these branches have anything important...)
- What if the merge goes wrong? (But I can always rollback, right?)
- What if I break the deployment? (But it's already working, so...)

## Questions for My MIT Brother

1. **Is this plan totally crazy?** Please tell me if I'm about to do something stupid
2. **Should I keep any of the other branches?** Maybe there's something I'm missing
3. **Any tips for the merge?** I've never done a big merge like this before
4. **What should I do if everything breaks?** (Please don't say "start over" üòÖ)

## The Bottom Line

I just want to clean up this mess so I can start Phase 3 without getting confused about which branch has what. The `phase-2-rebuild` branch has everything working, so I figured that should become the new master.

**Please tell me this is a reasonable plan and I'm not about to destroy my project!** üôè

Thanks for always being there to keep me from going completely off the rails. You're the best big brother a high school kid could ask for!

**P.S.** - The assignments page actually looks pretty good now! You should check it out when you get a chance. I'm kind of proud of it, even if my git skills are still a work in progress üòä

**P.P.S.** - I promise I'll be more careful about branching in the future. This whole "create a new branch for every little thing" approach got out of hand real quick!
