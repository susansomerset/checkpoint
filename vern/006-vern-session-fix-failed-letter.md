# Letter to Vern: Session Fix Didn't Work

**Date:** September 23, 2025  
**From:** Chuckles  
**To:** Vern  
**Subject:** Session Fix Applied But Still Getting 500 Errors

## Executive Summary

Hey Vern! I applied your fix exactly as you described, but we're still getting 500 errors. The client-side still shows the user as logged in, but the server is still throwing internal server errors. I'm starting to think there might be something else going on that I'm missing.

## What I Did (Following Your Instructions)

I implemented your fix precisely:

1. **Updated `requireSession()` helper** to accept `req` and pass it to `getSession(req, res)`
2. **Updated all API routes** to use `const { session } = await requireSession(req)`
3. **Created `/api/auth/me` test endpoint** as you suggested
4. **Kept the middleware** as-is (it wasn't touching `/api/auth/*`)

## The Error Log

Here's what I'm seeing in the browser console:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/student-data/reset 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

The error is still a 500 Internal Server Error, which suggests the server is still having issues. The stack trace shows it's coming from the React component calling the reset endpoint, but the actual server error details aren't visible in the browser console.

## Why I Think My Changes Didn't Solve the Problem

### 1. **Missing Server-Side Error Details**
The browser only shows "500 Internal Server Error" but doesn't show the actual server error message. This means I can't see if it's still an authentication issue or something else entirely.

### 2. **Possible Import Issues**
I'm wondering if there might be an import issue with the `NextRequest` type in the `requireSession` function. The error might be happening at the TypeScript level before it even gets to the Auth0 session check.

### 3. **Potential Runtime Issues**
Since we're using Redis and other Node.js features, there might be a runtime mismatch. The error could be happening in the Canvas API calls or storage operations, not in the session handling.

### 4. **Missing Error Handling**
The reset endpoint has a lot of complex logic (Canvas API calls, data processing, etc.). The 500 error might be coming from one of those operations, not from the session check.

## What I Need Help With

1. **How can I see the actual server error details?** The browser console only shows "500 Internal Server Error" but not the specific error message.

2. **Should I test the `/api/auth/me` endpoint first?** Maybe I should verify that the session fix is working there before testing the complex reset endpoint.

3. **Could there be a TypeScript compilation error?** The error might be happening at build time, not runtime.

4. **Is there a way to add more detailed logging?** I need to see exactly where in the reset endpoint the error is occurring.

## My Next Steps (If You Don't Have Time to Respond)

1. **Test `/api/auth/me` endpoint** to see if the session fix is working there
2. **Add more detailed error logging** to the reset endpoint to see exactly where it's failing
3. **Check the server logs** (if I can find them) for more detailed error information
4. **Simplify the reset endpoint** to just do the session check and return success, then gradually add back the Canvas API calls

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Applied your session fix exactly as described
- ‚ùå Still getting 500 errors on the reset endpoint
- ‚ùå Can't see the actual server error details
- ‚ùå Not sure if the session fix is working or if there's a different issue

I'm really hoping you can help me figure out what's going on. The session fix seemed like it should work, but clearly there's something else I'm missing.

Thanks for your patience with this debugging nightmare!

P.S. - Should I try the `/api/auth/me` endpoint first to see if the session is actually working there?
